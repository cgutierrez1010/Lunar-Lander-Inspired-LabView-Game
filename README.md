Lunar Tetris-Inspired LabVIEW Game

🚀 Overview
This is a LabVIEW-based physics game inspired by the classic Testris. The objective is to carefully land a spacecraft onto a moving platform of Boolean LEDs.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features
- **Moving Landing Platform** – Adds an extra layer of challenge.
- **Boolean LED Interaction** – The spaceship and landing zone are constructed using LabVIEW Boolean LEDs.
- **Crash or Land?** – Land too hard, and your mission fails!
- **Right and Left Buttons** – Control horizontal movement.
- **Stop Game Button** – Allows players to end the game anytime.
- **Score Meter** – Tracks player performance.
- **Background of Stars** – Enhances the space-themed experience.
- **Fail/Pass Message** - Lets the player know if they pass/fail the level. 

🛠 How to Play
1. Run the **VI file** in LabVIEW.
2. Use the **Right and Left buttons** to adjust horizontal movement.
3. Aim for the moving platform while **conserving fuel**.
4. Land softly to succeed!
5. Press **Stop Game** to end the session.
